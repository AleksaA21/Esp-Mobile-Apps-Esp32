# Esp-Idf-Mobile-App-Esp32

## For Arduino developers

For Esp32 Arduino we can have ESP-IDF codes together with Arduino codes

The Esp-Idf-Mobile-Apps-Esp32 is adapted to work in Arduino.
Inclusive the logging output is adapted to show logs in Arduino Serial Monitor.

Just copy the directory main to your Arduino project.

I recomend You start opennig the Example project in Arduino directory.

Notes: 
    - See recomendations to ESP-IDF code in main README.
    - The main directory is only to ESP-IDF code, or C/C++ pure code, 
        but can call any your Arduino subroutine there (functions).
    
This is a good start who not know yet the power of ESP-IDF
